now i finally have to learn abt git and githubü§∏‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇü§û
common commands used in Git
1. git init - to initialize a folder as a  
2. git add <file> - to add a file to what will be commited
3. git commit - to commit your progress
4. git status - check your progress ie commits, current branch etc.
5. git commit -m "the changes u made" - write a commit message in the quotation marks...should be under 50 xters long and should accurately describe what u changed in this commit
6. git add . - adds everything done in all files in the repository to the commit
7. git checkout "name of the branch u want to change to" - change between branches
8. git checkout -b "name of the new branch" - create a new branch
9. git merge "name of the branch" - this will merge the branch u are at with the branch u stated...i guess the it will go with the version of the stated one (not very clear yet send helpü•∫ü§ß)
10.git config --global user.name "hafsa" - to work with a remote repository u first need to set up a username and email shown below
11.git config --global user.email "hafsaryuzaki@gmail.com" - this is all for authentication and it may ask u to do it locally...it might also ask for yoput github password
12.git config --global --add safe.directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/Final_year_Project/PATH BASICALLY" - idk what this was but it was suggested to me and it worked fine after this
13.git remote add "remote name" "https://yourremoteurl" - adding a remote repository from github
14.git push -u "remote name" "branch name" - push changes to a remote repository. the -u just saves the settings what comes after it so next time u type git push it automatically remembers what came after
15.git pull "remote name" "branch name" - pull from a remote repository
 also idk what's with master and main i keep confusing themü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
